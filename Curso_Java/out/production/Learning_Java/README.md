    <h1>Welcome to the Java Complete Course By Loiane Groner!</h1>
    <h2>You can access the complete course by clicking here -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnORjqZUMIQ&list=PLGxZ4Rq3BOBq0KXHsp5J3PxyFaBIXVs3r&ab_channel=LoianeGroner" target="_blank">YouTube</a></h2>
    <p>This repository was created for learning Java through Loiane Groner's course. Here you will find the codes I will do throughout the course.</p>  
    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>The Java Complete Course is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of Java programming. The sections include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction to Java Programming: In this section, you will learn the basics of Java programming, including syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.</li>
      <li>Object-Oriented Programming: In this section, you will learn about object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
      <li>GUI Programming: In this section, you will learn how to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Java's Swing library.</li>
      <li>Exception Handling: In this section, you will learn how to handle errors and exceptions in your Java programs.</li>
      <li>Multithreading: In this section, you will learn how to create multithreaded programs in Java, allowing your programs to run more efficiently.</li>
      <li>File Handling: In this section, you will learn how to read from and write to files in Java.</li>
      <li>Networking: In this section, you will learn how to create networked applications in Java, allowing your programs to communicate with other programs over the internet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before taking this course, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts, such as variables, control structures, and functions. You should also have some experience with another programming language, such as Python or C++.</p>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this course, you will have achieved the following learning objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the fundamentals of Java programming, including syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.</li>
      <li>Understand object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
      <li>Be able to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Java's Swing library.</li>
      <li>Be able to handle errors and exceptions in your Java programs.</li>
      <li>Be able to create multithreaded programs in Java.</li>
      <li>Be able to read from and write to files in Java.</li>
      <li>Be able to create networked applications in Java.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with this course, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java Development Kit (JDK): This is the software development kit for Java. It includes everything you need to develop, compile, and run Java programs.</li>
      <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): This is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for developing Java programs. There are several IDEs available for Java, including Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have the necessary software installed, you can begin the course by starting with the first section, Introduction to Java Programming
